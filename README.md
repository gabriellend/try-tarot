# try-tarot

This is an in-progress repository to improve my Go skills. In the end it may include:
- flash cards and educational material to learn about tarot/how to read the cards
- receiving a personal reading, perhaps based on user input
- AI that compares your interpretation of a reading with that of an experienced reader
